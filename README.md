### Welcome to my GitHub library!

Thanks for checking out my page. I've been working hands on with the WordPress community since 2009. I'm a product developer with a large imagination, a kind heart, and a passion for education and character development. I hope you enjoy my work across the years and continue to find some interesting things here! I'd like to be the Adrian Belew of the WordPress world and I still have many good years ahead of me, so hopefully we'll cross, and possibly even keep paths. 

### Join my discord network! 

I use this server to curate and share news, music, tutorials, and more. Please consider it as my personal blog, as well as a place where other WordPress developers and people from all walks of life can hang out and network.
